# Aussie Tax Deductions Helper

## Overview & Goals

A comprehensive tax management application designed for Australian individuals, particularly salaried employees, who work from home or purchase work-related items.

The app's primary goals are to:

* Help users accurately calculate and claim all relevant work-related deductions, with a strong focus on work-from-home (WFH) expenses.
* Assist users in estimating their potential tax refund or payable amount from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
* Provide a robust system for record-keeping of income, expenses, and supporting documentation.

**Target Tax Jurisdiction:** Australia (ATO guidelines).
**Primary Users:** Salaried employees, but also other individuals incurring work-related expenses.

## User Profile & Example Scenario (Illustrative)

* **Primary Users:** Salaried employees, but also other individuals incurring work-related expenses.
* **Example Case:** A salaried employee with an annual income of 143,100 AUD (pre-tax, excluding superannuation) who works from home 3 out of 5 days a week.
    * **Home Office:** Uses a dedicated room (bedroom) of 3.7m x 2.9m (10.73 sqm).
    * **WFH Hours Example:** 943.25 hours logged from July 1, 2024, to June 4, 2025 (for the 2024-2025 financial year).
    * **Expenses:** Purchases items for home office (e.g., chair, monitor) and incurs other work-related expenses.

    * Diary/calendar view.
    * CSV import for hours.
    * Running total of WFH hours.

### 5. Tax Calculation & Estimation Engine

* **Logic:**
    1.  `Total Assessable Income = Sum of all income sources`
    2.  `Total Deductions = Sum of all eligible work-related expenses (including chosen WFH deduction)`
    3.  `Taxable Income = Total Assessable Income - Total Deductions`
    4.  `Gross Tax Payable = Apply ATO tax rates for 2024-2025 to Taxable Income`
    5.  `Net Tax Payable = Gross Tax Payable - Applicable Tax Offsets (e.g., LITO)`
    6.  `Estimated Refund/Payable = Tax Already Withheld - Net Tax Payable`
* **Features:**
    * Application of current ATO tax rates and thresholds.
    * Calculation of common tax offsets (checking eligibility).
    * Clear breakdown of the estimation.

### 6. Reporting & Record Keeping

* **Features:**
    * Comprehensive tax summary report (for self-lodgement via myTax or for a tax agent).
    * Secure local storage of all records.
    * Data export (CSV for data, PDF for summary report).
    * Data import (CSV for restoring data).

### 7. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Considerations

* Intuitive navigation and data entry.
* Progress tracking through the financial year.
* Guidance/tooltips explaining tax concepts.
* Responsive design.

### 8. Data Storage & Security

* **Storage Method:** All data (income, expenses, receipts, logs) is stored exclusively in the **user's browser local storage**.
* **No Persistent Server-Side Data:** The application will not store any user data on external servers.
* **Data Export/Import:**
    * Users can export all their data to a CSV file for backup or transfer.
    * Users can import data from a previously exported CSV file.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * Users should be informed that clearing their browser data (cache, local storage) for the site will permanently delete their stored information from the app. Regular export is recommended.
    * The app will not handle or store Tax File Numbers (TFNs) unless absolutely necessary for a specific report generation, and if so, with explicit user consent and prominent warnings about local storage security. For most estimation purposes, TFN is not required by the app itself.

## Key Design Considerations & FAQ

This section addresses specific questions regarding the app's design and functionality.

### 1. What are the essential data points the app needs to collect for a reasonably accurate tax estimation for a salaried employee with WFH expenses?

* **Personal Information (for report generation, user reference):**
    * Name (optional)
    * Financial Year being processed
* **Income:**
    * Gross salary/wages (from Income Statement).
    * Tax withheld (from Income Statement).
    * Bank interest received.
    * Dividends received (including franking credits).
* **Work-Related Expenses (Non-WFH):**
    * For each item: Description, date purchased, cost, work-related use percentage.
* **Work-From-Home (WFH) Expenses:**
    * **Hours Log:** Total hours worked from home.
    * **If using Actual Cost Method:** Electricity/gas bills (apportioned), internet/phone bills (apportioned), stationery costs, decline in value of home office equipment, cleaning costs (apportioned), dedicated office area (sqm) and total home area (sqm).
* **Other:**
    * Private health insurance details (if claiming the rebate as a tax offset).

### 2. How should the app structure the calculation flow, from income input to final estimated refund/payable?

1.  **User Onboarding/Setup:** Select Financial Year.
2.  **Income Input:** PAYG details, other income. -> *Total Assessable Income*.
3.  **WFH Module:** Log hours. Calculate deduction via Fixed Rate & Actual Cost. User selects one. -> *Chosen WFH Deduction*.
4.  **Other Work-Related Expenses Input:** Details of other deductions, including depreciation. -> *Total Other Work-Related Deductions*.
5.  **Calculate Total Deductions:** `Chosen WFH Deduction + Total Other Work-Related Deductions`. -> *Total Deductions*.
6.  **Calculate Taxable Income:** `Total Assessable Income - Total Deductions`. -> *Taxable Income*.
7.  **Calculate Gross Tax Payable:** Apply ATO tax rates (2024-2025) to Taxable Income. -> *Gross Tax Payable*.
8.  **Calculate Tax Offsets:** Determine applicable offsets (e.g., LITO). -> *Total Tax Offsets*.
9.  **Calculate Net Tax Payable:** `Gross Tax Payable - Total Tax Offsets`. -> *Net Tax Payable*.
10. **Estimate Refund or Payable:** `Total Tax Withheld - Net Tax Payable`. -> *Estimated Tax Refund/Payable*.
11. **Display Summary:** Show breakdown.

### 3. What are the key ATO guidelines or rulings the app MUST incorporate for WFH deductions and general work-related expenses for the 2024-2025 financial year?

* **General Work-Related Expenses:**
    * Must be directly related to earning income.
    * Must have spent the money and not been reimbursed.
    * Must have a record (receipts, etc.).
    * Apportion for private use.
* **Work-From-Home (WFH) Deductions (2024-2025):**
    * **Fixed Rate Method:**
        * **Rate:** 67 cents per hour (effective 1 July 2022 - **verify annually for ATO updates**).
        * **Covers:** Energy, internet, phone, stationery, computer consumables, low-cost asset decline in value.
        * **Record-keeping:** Record of all WFH hours, evidence of payment for expenses covered (e.g., one bill for each).
    * **Actual Cost Method:**
        * Claim actual work-related portion of all running expenses (energy, internet, phone, stationery, cleaning).
        * Claim decline in value for depreciable assets (desk, chair, computer).
        * **Record-keeping:** Detailed records for all expenses, apportionment calculations, WFH hours.
    * **No Double Dipping.**
    * **Eligibility:** Must be working from home to fulfil employment duties and incur additional deductible expenses.
* **Depreciation (Decline in Value):**
    * Use ATO-recognised effective life or allow user input.
    * Apply Prime Cost or Diminishing Value methods.
    * Consider rules for low-value pool or instant asset write-off if applicable.

**Crucial Note:** The app must be updated annually with the latest ATO rates, thresholds, and rulings for the relevant financial year. Information for 2024-2025 should be sourced directly from ato.gov.au.

### 4. How can the app help users choose between the fixed rate and actual cost methods for WFH deductions, showing potential outcomes for both?

1.  **Educate:** Explain each method, what it covers, and record-keeping needs.
2.  **Concurrent Calculation:** Calculate WFH deduction using both methods based on user inputs.
3.  **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Display "$X for Fixed Rate" vs. "$Y for Actual Cost".
4.  **Pros and Cons Summary:** Remind about simplicity vs. potentially higher claim and record-keeping effort.
5.  **User Choice:** Allow the user to select the method to apply.

### 5. What considerations are there for updating the app annually with new tax rates, thresholds, and ATO rulings?

* **Core Updatable Elements:** Income tax rates/brackets, WFH fixed rate, tax offset amounts/eligibility, Medicare levy/surcharge thresholds, depreciation rules.
* **Update Mechanism (Local App):**
    * Package updated rates/rules within new app versions (e.g., in a config file).
    * Clearly version the app for the financial year (e.g., "Aussie Tax Helper 2025-2026").
* **Communication:** Inform users about new versions for upcoming financial years.
* **Testing:** Rigorously test with new parameters annually.
* **ATO Monitoring:** Regularly check ato.gov.au for changes.
* **Disclaimer:** Always state the app provides estimates and is not professional advice.
