## Overview & Goals

This application is designed for Australian individuals, particularly salaried employees, who work from home or purchase work-related items. The primary goals are to:

* **Calculate & Claim Deductions:** Accurately calculate and claim all relevant work-related deductions, with a focus on WFH expenses using both the **ATO Fixed Rate** and **Actual Cost** methods.
* **Estimate Tax Outcome:** Assist users in estimating their potential tax refund or payable amount from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
* **Record-Keeping:** Provide a robust system for keeping records of income, expenses, and supporting documentation, all stored locally in the user's browser.

**Target Tax Jurisdiction:** Australia (ATO guidelines for the 2024-2025 Financial Year).

## Features

* **Income Management:**
    * Add multiple PAYG income statements (gross salary, tax withheld).
    * Track other income sources like bank interest and dividends.
* **Expense Tracking:**
    * Log general work-related expenses with categories (e.g., Self-Education, Tools of Trade).
    * Manage depreciable assets with **Prime Cost** and **Diminishing Value** depreciation methods.
* **Work-From-Home (WFH) Calculations:**
    * Compare deduction outcomes between the **ATO Fixed Rate Method** (67 cents per hour) and the **Actual Cost Method**.
    * Log WFH hours manually or import them via a CSV file.
* **Tax Estimation Engine:**
    * Calculates taxable income based on ATO tax rates for 2024-2025.
    * Applies common tax offsets like the Low Income Tax Offset (LITO) and the Private Health Insurance offset.
* **Data Management:**
    * **Local Storage:** All data is stored exclusively in your browser. No data is sent to a server.
    * **Import/Export:** Securely back up your data by exporting it to a JSON or CSV file, and restore it at any time.

## Technology Stack

* **HTML:** For the structure of the application.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For a modern, responsive user interface.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For all application logic, calculations, and DOM manipulation, organized into ES6 modules.

## Data Storage & Security

## Changelog

### Version 1.4.0
    * ***üöÄ Added***
        * ***Edit Functionality:*** Users can now edit existing PAYG income and general expense entries via a modal, improving data management flexibility.
        * ***WFH Hours CSV Import:*** Users can now bulk-import their Work-From-Home hours using a CSV file. The tool is flexible and supports multiple date and time formats.
        * ***Time Calculation and Display:*** WFH hours are now calculated based on total minutes for higher accuracy. The UI has been updated to display time totals in a more user-friendly HH:MM format, alongside the decimal equivalent used for tax calculations.
        * ***Table Sorting:*** The "General Expenses" and "WFH Depreciable Assets" tables are now automatically sorted by purchase date (oldest first) to improve organization and readability.
    * ***Fixed***
        * ***MLS Calculation Accuracy:*** The Medicare Levy Surcharge calculation now correctly includes personal superannuation contributions in the income test, as per ATO guidelines.
        * ***Future-Dated Expense Logic:*** Expenses with a purchase date in a future financial year are now properly excluded from the current year's deduction calculations.
        * ***Depreciation Calculation:*** Fixed a critical bug in the Diminishing Value method where assets with a 1-year effective life were incorrectly depreciated at 200% of their value. The calculation is now correctly capped at 100%.
        * ***Corrected the "Claim Schedule":*** display logic to ensure the Year 1 (Y1) value accurately reflects the pro-rata deduction for assets purchased part-way through the financial year.
        * ***User Interface (UI):*** Resolved a persistent bug where the "Remove" button for WFH Depreciable Assets was not working due to incorrect form handling by the browser. Buttons now have an explicit type="button" to prevent unintended form submissions.
        * ***Estimated Deduction (Fixed Rate)" field:*** Fixed a display issue where the "Estimated Deduction (Fixed Rate)" field was not updating correctly.
        ***CSV Export:*** Fixed a critical bug where the CSV export was incomplete. The export now correctly includes all data sections, including detailed WFH running costs and the full list of WFH assets.
    * ***Improved***
        * ***Input Validation:*** All numerical input fields now prevent negative values from being entered.
        * ***UI Clarity:*** The Low Income Tax Offset (LITO) line item is now hidden in the final summary if the calculated offset is zero, resulting in a cleaner report.
        * ***Added "Date" and "Method" columns:*** to the WFH Depreciable Assets table for better visibility.
        * ***JSON import:*** Improved the JSON import validation logic to prevent errors.
        * ***Legacy Storage:*** Added backwards compatibility to the data loading function to correctly handle and convert older data structures.
